## Installation

  Unic framework is for PHP, so it's requires PHP 5.6 or newer version. Now you wonâ€™t need to setup anything just yet.

### Install with composer

  - Install `composer` if you have not installed.

```shell
composer create-project unicframework/unic blog
```

  It will automatically create a `blog` project for you.
