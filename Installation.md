## Installation

  Unic framework is built for PHP, so it's requires PHP 7.4 or newer version and for now you wonâ€™t need to setup anything else.

### Install with composer

  - Install `composer` if you have not installed in your system.

```shell
composer create-project unicframework/unic blog
```

  It will automatically create a `blog` project for you.

### Start development server

  Start php development server:

```shell
php -S localhost:3000 index.php
```

It will start the development server at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
